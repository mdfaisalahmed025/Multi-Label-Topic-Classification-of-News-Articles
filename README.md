MultiLabelNews: Multi-Label Topic Classification of News Articles using BBC News and Guardian Data.  
An end-to-end project to build a **multi-label news classification system**, enabling accurate categorization of articles across multiple topics such as politics, economy, technology, and climate.

---

## Motivation

Modern news articles often cover **multiple overlapping topics**, making it difficult for traditional single-label classifiers to capture the full context. Poor classification limits **content organization, analytics, and recommendation systems**.

This project aims to:

- Automatically assign **multiple relevant topics** to news articles.
- Enable **scalable and accurate news categorization**.
- Facilitate insights for journalists, analysts, and AI-driven news platforms.

Students, researchers, and news platforms can answer questions like:

- Which topics frequently overlap in news coverage?
- How to automatically tag news articles with multiple relevant categories?
- Which models provide the best performance for multi-label classification?

By leveraging **transformer-based models and large-scale datasets**, this project empowers **data-driven news analysis and organization**.

## Training & Model Evaluation

### 🛠️ Model Training

- **Base Model:** `distilroberta-base` transformer encoder  
- **Task:** Multi-label topic classification of news articles  
- **Training Strategy:** Two-stage training with custom data loader  
- **Epochs:** 5 cycles per stage  
- **Accuracy:** Achieved **91% validation accuracy**, demonstrating strong generalization across multiple news topics  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, BLURR  

**Training Workflow:**

1. **Stage 1:** Initial training on full dataset to learn general topic distributions.  
2. **Stage 2:** Fine-tuning on preprocessed and cleaned dataset for higher accuracy and label balance.  
3. **BLURR Inference:** Used BLURR for accelerated inference pipelines, ensuring batch-efficient processing.  
4. **ONNX Conversion:** Exported the trained model to **ONNX** for CPU-optimized inference and deployment.  
5. **Quantization Attempt:** Model quantization failed due to shape inconsistencies; inference continues with full precision ONNX models.
